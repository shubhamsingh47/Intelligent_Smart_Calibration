# Intelligent Smart Calibration

## Welcome to the **Intelligent Calibration Engine** 
### An end-to-end Machine Learning application that intelligently calibrates sensor readings from medical or industrial sensors.

## ðŸ’¡ Features
- Upload sensor data directly (.xlsx, .csv, .xls, .tsv)
- Automated calibration using ML models.
- Visualization of calibrated vs. reference distributions.
- Download calibrated results ðŸ“¥ 
- Clean and responsive UI with navigation menu.

## ðŸ“¦ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhamsingh47/Intelligent_Smart_Calibration.git
cd Intelligent_Smart_Calibration 
```

2. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
